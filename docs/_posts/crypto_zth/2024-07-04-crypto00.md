"To whom it may concern"... This is my first blog post in a long time, well at least since high school, when I used to be pretty active in Android and Minecraft forums.
Nevertheless, time passes by, new things are learnt and others are forgotten. The best way to avoid forgetting notions and skills is, of course, to do something which requires using and deepening them.

This is the main reason why I find the field of cryptography fascinating: it spans concepts from subjects which one may know well, together with others that you may have heard of in that course you didn't really enjoy, or just heard as a buzzword somewhere, up to things you didn't know people actually studied or even existed (sorry, I have never seen a documentary about [elliptic curve twists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twists_of_elliptic_curves)).

Another nice plus is that cryptography is actually used in the real world: in the same way scientific computing allows people to actually see (at least simulated) the beautiful fundamental laws of physics in action, cryptography allows us to put in action more or less advanced concepts of mathematics and computer science.
