This is my first blog post in a long time, at least since high school, when I used to be pretty active in several Android and Minecraft forums.
Nevertheless, time passes by, new things are learnt and others are forgotten. The best way to avoid forgetting notions and skills is, of course, to do something which requires using and deepening them.

### What is this all about?
As an attempting researcher in cryptography[^1], with a passion for high performance algorithms, I get to see various bits and pieces of the field, some which I like (or simply deal with) more than others. 
This is the introduction to a series of blog posts, hopefully coherently structured, that will act as a sort of public diary from which someone else might also benefit.
The title, other than a play of words, sets the expectations for this series: it's going to be about cryptography, and will include topics such as [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof); 
its length is going to be \\(O\left(n\right)\\), not \\(\Theta\left(n\right)\\), because I cannot gaurantee any a-priori lower bound on its length.


[^1]: Since it is well-established that [cryptology is blockchain astrology](https://youtu.be/xsmMStLKJw4?si=jsP04OYkOw1cm20u&t=2880), I will use the term *cryptography* to refer both to the design and the analysis aspects of the field.


### The Magical and Very Real World of Cryptography

I find the field of cryptography fascinating: it spans concepts from subjects which one may know well, together with others that you may have heard of in that course you didn't really enjoy, or just heard as a buzzword somewhere, up to things you didn't know people actually studied or even existed (sorry, I have never seen a documentary about [elliptic curve twists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twists_of_elliptic_curves)).

Furthermore, cryptography is actually used in the real world: in the same way scientific computing allows people to actually see (at least simulated) the beautiful fundamental laws of physics in action, cryptography allows us to put in action more or less advanced concepts of mathematics and computer science.
To me, this is another big plus: a cryptographic scheme is often just as useful as it is efficient, and the interplay between security, performance, and energy consumption introduces additional facets which allows for a variety of trade-offs and possible choices.
