### Symbols, Alphabets, Strings.
When approached in a formal way, cryptography, particularly modern one, should be considered as 
a branch of [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), more than 
algebra or complexity theory. 
Sure, having well-founded tools that help us make sense of what we build is essential, but in 
principle not necessary. 

Consider the concept of *encryption*, intended as the process of manipulating a 
*plaintext message* $M$, producing a *ciphertext message* $C$, in such a way that deducing 
any property of $M$ from $C$ is impossible[^1], unless a certain *secret key* $K$ is known: 
in general, $M$, $C$ and $K$ could be anything, and the encryption procedure, let's call it $E$, can 
also be quite general: indeed, $E$ could be a randomized process which might not even always produce 
correct results, or even terminate for some combinations of plaintext and secret key! 
It is a bit limiting to already start posing limits, at the most general level possible, on the 
ways such things may work.

A first "restriction" (which really isn't one) we can make about our messages, keys, and other kinds 
of objects, is that they are *finite sequences of symbols*, a.k.a.\ *strings*, where the symbols 
belong to a certain *alphabet* $\mathcal{A}$.

### "Wait, everything is not just zeros and ones?" "Never has been..."
Although some famous general results in [computation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_speedup_theorem),
allow us to basically treat everything as a "sequence of zeros and ones", in the same way our 
good old digital computers do, so that it is customary to have $\mathcal{A} = \set{\hex{0}, \hex{1}}$, 
there are cases in which we need to treat this equivalence with care.

Godspeed,

[^1]: For the sake of simplicity, we say impossible: in the future, we will start using more appropriate terms of the technical jargon, such as *infeasible* or *negligible*. Similarly, the fact that "any property" of $M$ cannot be deduced from $C$ is also often a bit too strong.
