This website is still work-in-progress. is a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site].

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how Github Pages work.

Do you have questions? feel free to [open an issue][issue] or find out how toreach me from my [contact page][contact].

Have a great day!!
